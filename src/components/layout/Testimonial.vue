          "Two invigorating engagements with SAP in two weeks: helping us to
          build the foundation for our GE Aviation Customer Experience program.
          First an amazing customer journey mapping session in Dayton with 32
          talented GE Aviation Systems leaders and then Firestarters meet up
          this week with Industry peers. Both live! I am invigorated and exited
          for our customers and people!"

        <h2>Valentine Emmanuel | Experience Design Lead | Daiichi Sankyo</h2>

        <p>
          "CX Firestarter community's goal is to innovate around the customer.
          It is where people from exceptional backgrounds come together to
          discuss the future of digital customer experience and connect with
          like-minded leaders."

        <h2>Heinrich Wilking | Founder | Riscoverse Consulting Gmbh</h2>

        <p>
          "I enjoyed a lot the Firestarter in-person event in Berlin today â€“ it
          was a very open and collaborative environment where people from a
          range of industries and backgrounds exchanged about topics on customer
          experience. Since then I have joined subsequent Firestarter sessions
          online and continue to be amazed by the rich conversations and
          insights I get from the community members."
